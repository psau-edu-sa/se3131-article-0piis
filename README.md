# a researsh about Unified Modelling Language.
A visual modelling language for software systems is the unified modelling language ( UML ).
A notation created by Rational Corporation, which is now a division of IBM, for modeling
object-oriented systems. It offers a visual method for describing, building, and documenting
object-oriented systems. It also makes it easier to comprehend the system’s architecture and
control the complexity of a big system.” Overview of UML, A UML specification consists of
precise, complete and unambiguous models. The models may be employed to generate code
in programming language such as java or C++.” The opposite is also feasible, allowing one to
work with either the textual notation of a programming language or the graphical notation of
UML. Understanding UML’s fundamental building elements, the rules for mixing those
building block, and the universal procedures that apply across the language are prerequisites
for using it. Three different categories of construction blocks are used: things, relationships
and diagrams. Things: The UML’s object-oriented building pieces are called things. They
consist of structural, behavioral, grouping, and annotational things. The verbs in UML models
are called structural things; the nouns in UML are called behavioral things; the dynamic
elements of UML are called grouping things; and the explanatory sections are called
annotation things. Relationship: UML recognizes four different types of relationships:
Dependency, Association, Generalization, Extensibility. Dependency is a term used to
describe a relationship between two system components where a modification to one
component has an impact on the other component ( dependent thing ). Association
represents a set of relationships between components in a system and how elements in a
UML diagram are related. A structural link between a whole and its pieces is represented by
an aggregate. In a parent/child connection, a generalization occurs when the objects of the
specialized element (child) are used in place of the objects of the generalized element (the
parent). Extensibility is a term used to describe a process that allow a language to convey
additional system behavior. UML diagrams: The many UML diagrams offer a graphic
representation of the system from various angles. Classes are the most crucial component of
any object-oriented system, and they are both concepts borrowed from object-oriented
design. A class is a collection of objects that have similar meanings, relationships, method,
and characteristics. Classes: Classes can represent both physical and software items. For
instance, individual doors and windows are objects, but walls, doors, and windows are all
classes. Instead than representing a single item, a class does so. Customers and accounts are
the two main kinds of automated bank teller machines (ATMs). Both the customer and
account data structures and the operations on them are described in the class specification.
These are the actual bank clients and their accounts, and there are numerous instances of
both.
